  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      You are given <strong>nine stacks</strong> of cards laid out face-up in a 3x3 grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      On your turn, you must select a stack and predict whether the next card will register as <strong>higher</strong> or <strong>lower</strong> than the value currently displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Survive <strong>three correct predictions</strong> and the program spares you.  
      But a single failure triggers the anomaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of cards in your chosen stack becomes your sentence.  
      A digital countdown begins, binding you in static until it reaches zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock drains only at the mercy of the others connected to the machine.  
      They tap, each strike pushing the timer forward — perhaps rushing you to safety… or slowing the feed so you remain trapped in the signal.
