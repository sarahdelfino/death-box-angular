<h2>How to Play</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    The table is set with <strong>9 stacks of cards</strong>.  
    On your turn, you must choose a stack of cards and declare whether the next card from the deck will be <strong>higher or lower</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Guess correctly <strong>3 times</strong> and you survive your turn.  
    Guess wrong, and your fate is sealed...
  </p>
  <p>
    A cursed potion appears. You must drink until the potion is completely drained. The other players become your tormentors, counting down by draining the poison until your sentence is served.
  </p>
  <p>
    You cannot stop until the counter runs out.  
    Choose your friends wisely... and pray the deck is merciful.
