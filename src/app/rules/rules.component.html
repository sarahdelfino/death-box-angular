  <h3>Remember:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>This is a drinking game. Know your limits and drink responsibly.</strong></li>
    <li>Ace is <strong>low</strong>, just to be annoying.</li>
    <li>If you pull a <strong>joker</strong>, you always drink and the joker goes to the <strong>bottom</strong> of the stack.</li>
    <li>When the deck runs out, stacks are merged and reshuffled to keep the game going. The goal is to survive until only <strong>one stack</strong> remains.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>On Your Turn</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose one of the <strong>nine face-up stacks</strong>.</li>
    <li>Predict whether the next card will be <strong>higher</strong> or <strong>lower</strong>.</li>
    <li>Get <strong>three predictions</strong> right to end your turn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If You’re Wrong</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The size of the stack becomes your <strong>drinking time</strong>.</li>
    <li>A countdown starts — drink until it hits zero.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Counters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>They can help you out… or make it worse. Tap to <strong>speed up</strong> the drinking time.</li>
